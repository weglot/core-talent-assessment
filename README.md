Hello and welcome on Weglot Talent Assessment !

This PHP test will ask you to implement simple encoding algorithms and tests them with Phpunit.

Requirements:
* Git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* PHP >= 5.3 (https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php)
* PHP Zip (https://www.php.net/manual/zip.installation.php)


First, you need to fork this repo and clone it on your computer.

Then, when you are ready to start the test you need to run the following command :
```
php talent-assessment start
```

This will create an ```app/``` directory where you will find class to implement.

We recommend you to implement class in this order : ```CompositeEncodingAlgorithm```, ```OffsetEncodingAlgorithm``` and ```SubstitutionEncodingAlgorithm```.

To run unit tests in order to check your code :
```
php vendor/bin/phpunit
```

When you've completed the talent assessment, run the following command :
```
php talent-assessment finish
```

Finally, open a pull-request between our repo and your fork [here](https://github.com/weglot/core-talent-assessment/compare).

Good luck !
