Hello and welcome on Weglot Talent Assessment !

This PHP test will ask you to implement simple encoding algorithms and tests them with Phpunit.


First, you need to fork this repo and clone it on your computer.

Then, when you are ready to start the test you need to run the following command :
```
php talent-assessment start
```

This will create an ```app/``` directory where you will find class to implement.

We recommend you to implement class in this order : ```CompositeEncodingAlgorithm```, ```OffsetEncodingAlgorithm``` and ```SubstitutionEncodingAlgorithm```.

To run unit tests in order to check your code :
```
php vendor/bin/phpunit
```

When you've completed the talent assessment, run the following command :
```
php talent-assessment finish
```

Finally, open a pull-request between our repo and your fork [here](https://github.com/weglot/core-talent-assessment/compare).

Good luck !
